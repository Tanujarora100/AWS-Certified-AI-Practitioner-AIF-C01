            - üí°¬†Computers have been traditionally bad at understanding chain of intents
    - **Utterance**: a phrase or way in which an intent might be said
        - Intents are trained with sample utterances
        - e.g. ‚ÄúCan I order a pizza‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want a pizza‚Äù, ‚ÄúPizza, please‚Äù‚Ä¶
    - **Slot**: key parameters inside an utterance
        - e.g. pizza size (small/medium/large), crust (normal/cheesy)
- **Use cases: all sorts of voice bots**
    - Chatbots
    - Voice Assistants
    - Q&A Bots
    - Info/Enterprise bots
